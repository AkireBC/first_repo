        <h2>About Me And My Hobby</h2>    
        <p>My name is Erika Borrali and I reside in San Francisco for almost 23 years.  Iâ€™m a mom of two beautiful kids ages 6 and 8 years old.  My hobby is to go hiking.  I enjoy hiking because I like walking on uneven terrains, watch out for rocks, branches, and other obstacles, as well as observing nature. It helps me physically and mentally as well.  Also, it helps my kids stay active and moving. Make the hike interactive with a nature-themed scavenger hunt or a hike to a cool feature, like a waterfall.</p>

        <h2>Details About Hiking</h2>
        <p>To start your hiking hobby, the only skill you need is the ability to walk. Just place one foot in front of the other to hike. Just find a short, easy trail nearby and go hiking. The shoes you wear are very important as it can lead to sore feet and a short hike. Terrain shoes are the best, but light hiking shoes are just fine.The pants to wear for a hike are the ones that are breathable and help keep you cool or warm depending on the temperature.  Don't wear denim jeans when hiking, as they can be uncomfortable.</P>
